    <h1>The Stylt Programming Language</h1>
    <p>A programming language built with several design criteria:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All language constructs and concepts are to be as minimal and orthogonal as possible, while maintaining maximal expressivity</li>
        <li>Language Primitives (syntax, type theoretic, and semantically) are designed to be as low-level as possible</li>
        <li>Expansive and Expandable Type Theory</li>
        <li>Categorical Semantics</li>
        <li>Syntax that enables the above considerations to be maximally expressive</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Design Decisions reached by following the above criteria:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Language Primitives motivated by a novel Process Calculus, Category Theory, Classical Linear Logic</li>
        <li>Multi-Mode Multi-Modal Dependent Type Theory</li>
        <li>Semantics are expressed in a Static/Dynamic split presentation
		    <ul>
		        <li>The presentation is most clearly inspired by the work of Robert Harper as laid out in "Practical Foundations for Programming Languages"</li>
		        <li>However, there are several departures and significant alteration to accomodate the Modality Enforced Multi-Phase Semantics</li>
		    </ul>
		</li>
        <li>Syntax is inspired and informed by the underlying composition-based semantics</li>
    </ul>
